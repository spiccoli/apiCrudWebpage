------WORK IN PROGRESS------<br>
Needs to be hosted locally for it to work, I used Xammp.<br>
This simple website aims to create a functional authentication system, being able to signup, send it to the database in order to then be able to log in using your credentials<br>

The database I used is the one located at phpmyadmin. (mysql)
