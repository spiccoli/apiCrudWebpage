Needs to be hosted locally for it to work, I used Xammp.
This simple website aims to create a functional authentication system, being able to signup and log in using your credentials <br>
it was made using the following technologies:<br>
Tailwind for styling<br>
PHP to connect the user's input to the database<br>
MySQL for the database (I've implemented MySQL using phpadmin)<br>
